\begin{abstract}
	This project covers the design, and implementation using SystemVerilog, of a picoMIPS embedded processor. The processor designed is Turing complete (if infinite memory were available), but is tailored to the execution of an affine pixel transform.
	
	The architecture created is minimal in size, however a modular and parametric design allows for simple extension and modification for other purposes.
	
	In addition to the processor design, a feature-rich assembler was written using Python, capable of translating high level assembly instructions into a series of machine code instructions.
	
	A signed binary number to binary coded decimal converter was also created in order to allow decimal display of the binary output word using 7-segment displays.
